## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source**: USA Housing dataset  
- **Target**: `Price`  
- **Features**:  
  - Avg. Area Income  
  - Avg. Area House Age  
  - Avg. Area Number of Rooms  
  - Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms  
  - Area Population

## 🧠 Models Implemented
- **Linear Models**: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet  
- **Polynomial & Regularization**: Polynomial Regression, HuberRegressor  
- **Ensemble & Boosting**: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- **Others**: SVR, KNN, SGDRegressor, MLPRegressor (Neural Net)  

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- **R² Score**  

📌 **Key Results**:  
- **XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest** → R² ~0.96–0.97 (Top performers)  
- **MLPRegressor** → R² ~0.93 (Strong neural network baseline)  
- **Polynomial Regression & SGDRegressor** → Underperformed due to overfitting/instability
